# RHDH OCP Coverage Analysis

Cross-reference RHDH cluster pools, CI test configurations, RHDH lifecycle data, and OCP lifecycle data to identify coverage gaps and stale configurations.

## When to Use

Use this skill when you need to:

- Check if RHDH CI coverage matches the current RHDH-supported OCP versions
- Find OCP versions that RHDH no longer supports but still have active pools or test entries
- Find RHDH-supported OCP versions missing cluster pools or test entries
- Plan OCP version additions or removals for a new RHDH release

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.9+
- Internet connectivity to reach `https://access.redhat.com`
- Works from any directory (auto-detects local `openshift/release` checkout or uses GitHub API)

## Composed Skills

This skill composes data from:

- **`lifecycle-ocp`**: RHDH and OCP version lifecycle data (via shared `ocp-lifecycle.jq`)
- **`prow-ocp-pools`**: Cluster pool configurations
- **`prow-ocp-jobs`**: CI test entry configurations

## Usage

Run the bundled analysis script:

```bash
uv run scripts/analyze_coverage.py
```

### Override repo location

```bash
uv run scripts/analyze_coverage.py --repo-dir /path/to/openshift/release
```

## Two Dimensions of Support

The analysis checks two independent dimensions for each OCP version:

| Dimension | Source | Meaning |
|-----------|--------|---------|
| **OCP supported** | OCP lifecycle API | The OCP version itself is still receiving updates (Full, Maintenance, or EUS) |
| **RHDH supported** | RHDH lifecycle API (`openshift_compatibility` field) | RHDH officially supports running on this OCP version |

An OCP version must satisfy **both** to warrant a cluster pool and test entry:

- An OCP-EOL version should always be removed (regardless of RHDH compatibility)
- An OCP-supported but non-RHDH-supported version should be reviewed

## How `main` Branch Is Handled

The `main` branch targets the **next unreleased RHDH version**. Since it's unreleased, it doesn't appear in the RHDH lifecycle API. The script estimates its OCP support as:

> Latest active RHDH release's OCP versions **+** any newer OCP versions that have reached GA

## Output Sections

### 1. Current State

- Cluster pool versions with sizing
- Test entry versions per product branch
- RHDH lifecycle with per-release OCP compatibility
- OCP lifecycle with supported/EOL versions

### 2. OCP Version Matrix

A combined view showing each relevant OCP version with:

| Column | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| OCP | Version number |
| OCP_SUPP | Is OCP itself still supported? |
| RHDH_SUPP | Does any active RHDH release support this OCP? |
| OCP_PHASE | Current OCP lifecycle phase |
| RHDH_RELEASES | Which RHDH releases support this OCP |

### 3. Analysis Results

Actions are categorized by severity:

- **REMOVE** -- Definitive: OCP version is end-of-life, resources should be deleted
- **REVIEW** -- Needs judgment: OCP is supported but RHDH compatibility doesn't match
- **ADD** -- Missing: RHDH-supported OCP version lacks a pool or test entry

### 4. Summary

Counts per action category plus the per-branch OCP support mapping.

## Workflow

After running the analysis:

1. **Handle REMOVE items first** -- delete pools/tests for OCP-EOL versions
2. **Review REVIEW items** -- decide based on context whether they need action
3. **Handle ADD items** -- use `prow-ocp-pools` and `prow-ocp-jobs` skills
4. **Run `make update`** after all changes (requires local checkout)
5. **Commit both config and generated files** together
