name: rhdh-pr-review
description: Test PR changes on a live RHDH cluster. Fetches CI-built images from PR comments, checks cluster status (deploying if needed), swaps images into the running deployment, and generates a targeted review checklist from the diff. Currently supports rhdh-operator PRs.

<essential_principles>

<principle name="ensure_cluster">
Always verify the user has a running RHDH cluster with `oc` access before attempting image swaps.
Check `oc whoami` and `oc get deployment -A | grep rhdh-operator` first.
If no cluster at all (`oc whoami` fails), **provision one via rhdh-test-instance PR workflow** — comment `/test deploy operator 1.9 4h` on a PR in `redhat-developer/rhdh-test-instance` using `gh pr comment`. No local clone needed.
If cluster exists but no RHDH, deploy using rhdh-test-instance locally (`make install-operator && make deploy-operator`).
Don't just tell the user to set things up — do it.
</principle>

<principle name="use_pr_comment_images">
Extract image URLs from PR comments posted by CI — never construct image URLs manually.
The tag format includes PR number + commit SHA, which only CI knows.
See `references/operator-pr-images.md` for extraction commands.
</principle>

<principle name="patch_not_redeploy">
Swap images on a running deployment rather than redeploying from scratch.
Use `oc set image` to patch the operator deployment in place — this is faster and preserves existing state (Backstage CRs, config, Keycloak).
</principle>
